## Functions

### `Print`

```rs
Print(text str)
```
Prints `str` in the console for debugging.


### `PrintDebugInfo`

```rs
PrintDebugInfo()
```
Prints debug info: the number of entities created and the amount of memory used by the script.


### `SetLevelSize`

```rs
SetLevelSize(fixed width, fixed height)
```
Sets the level's size. Implicitly adds walls to make sure that entities can not go outside of the level's boundaries. `width` and `height` are clamped to the range ]0fx, 6000fx]. If this function is not called, the level size is (10fx, 10fx), which is uselessly small for most cases.


### `AddWall`

```rs
AddWall(fixed start_x, fixed start_y, fixed end_x, fixed end_y) -> number
```
Adds a wall to the level from (`start_x`,`start_y`) to (`end_x`,`end_y`), and returns its wall ID. A maximum of 200 walls can be added to a level.


### `RemoveWall`

```rs
RemoveWall(number wall_id)
```
Remove the wall with the given `wall_id`.


### `AddUpdateCallback`

```rs
AddUpdateCallback(fn())
```
Adds a callback that will be updated at each game tick.


### `GetNumberOfPlayers`

```rs
GetNumberOfPlayers() -> number
```
Returns the number of players in the game.


### `IncreasePlayerScore`

```rs
IncreasePlayerScore(number player_index, number delta)
```
Increases the score of the player at the specified `player_index` by an amount of `delta`. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1]. Note that `delta` can be negative.


### `IncreasePlayerScoreStreak`

```rs
IncreasePlayerScoreStreak(number player_index, number delta)
```
Increases the score streak counter of the player at the specified `player_index` by an amount of `delta`. This counter is used to determine at which level of score streak the player is at. In turn, the score streak level is used to determine how much pointonium is given. Typically the score streak counter should be increased when an enemy is destroyed with the same score that the enemy provide. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1]. Note that `delta` can be negative.


### `GetPlayerScoreStreak`

```rs
GetPlayerScoreStreak(number player_index) -> number
```
Returns a number between 0 and 3. 0 is the lowest score streak (no pointonium is given), while 3 is the highest (3 pointoniums is usually given)


### `StopGame`

```rs
StopGame()
```
Ends the current game.


### `GetPlayerInputs`

```rs
GetPlayerInputs(number player_index) -> (fixed, fixed, fixed, fixed)
```
Returns the inputs of the player at the specified `index`. The return values are in order: the movement joystick's angle (between 0 and 2pi), the movement joystick's distance (between 0 and 1), the shoot joystick's angle (between 0 and 2pi), and the shoot joystick's distance (between 0 and 1).


### `GetPlayerScore`

```rs
GetPlayerScore(number player_index) -> number
```
Returns the score of the player at the specified `player_index`. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1].


### `ConfigurePlayer`

```rs

    fixed camera_y_override,
    fixed camera_distance,
    fixed camera_rotation_x_axis,
    number move_joystick_color,
    number shoot_joystick_color
})
```
Configures the player at the specified `player_index`. `player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1]. A `camera_distance` less than 0fx makes the camera move away from the ship. `camera_rotation_x_axis` is in radian and rotates along the X axis. To temporarily override the XY position of the camera, set **both** `camera_x_override` and `camera_y_override`; this will make the camera be interpolated from wherever it was, to that new position.


### `ConfigurePlayerHud`

```rs
ConfigurePlayerHud(number player_index, struct{
    text top_left_line
})
```
Configures the player's HUD.`player_index` must in the range [0, get_number_of_players() - 1].

})
```
Configures the weapon of the ship identified with `ship_id` using `configuration`. `frequency` determines the frequency of the shots. `cannon` determines the type of cannon. `duration` determines the number of game ticks during which the weapon will be available. Once the duration expires, the weapon reverts to its permanent configuration. If `duration` is omitted, the weapon will be permanently set to this configuration. If `frequency` or `cannon` is omitted, the ship is configured to not have any weapon.


### `ConfigureShipWallTrail`

```rs
ConfigureShipWallTrail(entity ship_id, struct{
    number wall_length
})
```
Configures a wall trail that kills everything inside when the ship it is attached to creates a loop with it. `wall_length` is clamped to  [100, 4000]. In Partitioner, the length is 2000. If `wall_length` is not specified, the trail is removed.


### `ConfigureShip`

```rs
ConfigureShip(entity ship_id, struct{
    bool swap_inputs
})
```
Configures various properties of the player ship identified by`id`


### `DamageShip`

### `SetShipSpeed`

```rs
SetShipSpeed(entity ship_id, fixed factor, fixed offset, number duration) -> fixed
```
Sets and returns the **effective speed** of the specified player ship as a function of the **base speed** of the ship. By default, a player ship moves according to its base speed, which is 10 distance units per tick (in the future, different ships may have different base speeds). Assuming the base speed of the ship is S, the new effective speed will be `(factor*S)+offset`. `duration` is the number of ticks during which the effective speed will be applied. Afterwards, the ship's speed reverts to its base speed. If `duration` is negative, the effective speed never reverts to the base speed.


### `GetAllEntities`

```rs
GetAllEntities() -> list<entity>
```
Returns the list of the entityIDs of all the entities currently in the level. This includes the various bullets and *all* the custom entities.

### `SetEntityMeshAngle`

```rs
SetEntityMeshAngle(entity entity_id, fixed angle, fixed x_axis, fixed y_axis, fixed z_axis)

### `SetEntityVisibilityRadius`

```rs
SetEntityVisibilityRadius(entity entity_id, fixed radius)
```
Sets the radius defining the visibility of the entity. This allows the game to know when an entity is actually visible, which in turns allows to massively optimize the rendering. Use the smallest value possible. If not set, the rendering radius is an unspecified large number that effectively makes the entity always be rendered, even if not visible.


### `SetEntityWallCollision`

```rs
SetEntityWallCollision(entity entity_id, bool collide_with_walls, fn(entity entity, number x, number y))
```
`collide_with_walls` configures whether the entity should stop when colliding with walls. If `collision_callback` is not nil, it is called anytime a collision is detected. The callback gets called with the entity id of the entity withthe callback, and with the normal to the wall.


### `SetEntityPlayerCollision`

```rs
SetEntityPlayerCollision(entity entity_id, fn(entity entity, number x, entity other))
```
Sets the callback for when the customizable entity identified by `id` collides with a player's ship. The callback gets called with the entity id of the entity with the callback, and the player_index and ship_id that were involved in the collision. Don't forget to set a radius on the customizable entity, otherwise no collisions will be detected.


### `SetEntityWeaponCollision`

```rs
SetEntityWeaponCollision(entity entity_id, fn(entity entity, number x, WeaponType weapon) -> bool)
```
Sets the callback for when the customizable entity identified by `id` collides with a player's weapon. The callback gets called with the entity_id of the entity on which the callback is set, the player_index of the player that triggered the weapon, and the type of the weapon. The callback *must* return a boolean saying whether the entity reacts to the weapon. In the case of a bullet, this boolean determines whether the bullet should be destroyed.


### `SpawnEntity`

```rs
SpawnEntity(entity entity_id, number spawning_duration)
```
Makes the customizable entity identified by `id` spawn for a duration of `spawning_duration` game ticks.


### `ExplodeEntity`

```rs
ExplodeEntity(entity entity_id, number explosion_duration)
```
Makes the customizable entity identified by `id` explode for a duration of `explosion_duration` game ticks. After the explosion, the entity is destroyed. `explosion_duration` must be less than 255. Any scale applied to the entity is also applied to the explosion.


### `SetEntityTag`

```rs
SetEntityTag(entity entity_id, number tag)
```
Sets a tag on customizable entities. The tag can be read back with `customizable_entity_get_tag`.


### `GetEntityTag`

```rs

```
Returns the tag that was set, or 0 if no tag was set.
