## Comments

Comments in Hybroid are like in any other C-style language.

`//` indicates a single-line comment.

```rs
// I am a single-line comment!
Pewpew:Print("Hello, World!")
```

`/*` and `*/` indicate a multi-line comment.

```rs
/*
 I am a multi-line comment!
 Cool, right?
*/
Pewpew:Print("Hello, World!")
```

## Semicolons

Just like in Lua, semicolons are treated as a whitespace character.
