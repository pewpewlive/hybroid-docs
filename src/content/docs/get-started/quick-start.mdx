</Aside>

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/pewpewlive/hybroid-live/releases/latest).

2. Move the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

3. Rename `hybroid-xxxxxx-xxxxxx` to `hybroid` (or from `hybroid-xxxxxx-xxxxxx.exe` to `hybroid.exe` on Windows).

4. Go to settings and add the directory to your PATH.

5. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
hybroid -v
```

The console output should look something like this:

```
> hybroid -v
hybroid-live version 0.1.0
```

And voil√†! You are ready to create your first project!

## Setting up VS Code

1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a fork like VSCodium, Cursor or Windsurf.

2. Download the Hybroid Live extension from [GitHub](https://github.com/pewpewlive/hybroid-vscode/releases/latest).

3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Install from VSIX`.

The extension will be released to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace in the future.

## Setting up ppl-utils

Since Hybroid Live is a language for PewPew Live, it requires [ppl-utils](https://github.com/pewpewlive/ppl-utils) to be installed as well.

## Creating the project

Creating a project in Hybroid Live is trivial. Navigate to a directory of your choice and use:

```bash
hybroid init --package hello-world --name "hello, world!" --output out
```

`package` is the name of the package, `name` is the name of the level, and `output` is the output directory.
