This guide will help you get started with Hybroid by installing it and creating your first Hybroid project.

## Installation

**ðŸš§ Installation instructions are prototypes!**

Run this command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```powershell title="PowerShell"
    irm "https://example.com" | iex
    ```

    You may need to change the execution policy:

    ```powershell title="PowerShell"
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```bash title="Bash"
    curl "https://example.com" | sh
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```zsh title="Zsh"
    curl "https://example.com" | sh
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After installation, enter `hybroid about` to check whether Hybroid has been installed.

The console output should look something like this:

```
> hybroid about
Hybroid v0.0.0

And voilÃ ! You are ready to create your first project!

## Creating the project

Creating a project in Hybroid is trivial. Use `hybroid init` to initialize the project. You will be asked a few questions while doing so.
