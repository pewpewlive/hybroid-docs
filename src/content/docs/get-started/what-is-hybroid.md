Hybroid is a programming language, designed to improve the PewPew Live developer experience.

Hybroid was created to overcome the limitations of Lua and projects like PewPewScript.

Benefits of Hybroid:
- Contains many new features which are missing in Lua
- Optimized OOP via structs and entities
- Automatic dead-code elimination
- Strict typing
- Certain PewPew APIs are now an integral part of Hybroid (such as `tick` statement)
- Native support for fixedpoint numbers (including support for degree-to-radian conversion, transpile-time float-to-fixedpoint conversion)
- Native support for PewPew Marketplace

However, Hybroid does come with certain limitations:
- Not beginner-friendly
- Limited support for Lua helpers and libraries
