Hybroid is a programming language, tailored for the PewPew Live developer experience.

Hybroid was created to overcome the limitations and shortcomings of Lua, as well as to provide a better developer experience.

Benefits of Hybroid:
- Contains many new features which are missing in Lua (such as enums, structs, etc.)
- PewPew Live specific features (such as the tick loop or entities)
- State of the art error messages, inspired by Rust and Scala
- Optimized OOP via structs and entities
- Familiar syntax reminiscent of Rust and other popular languages
- Automatic dead-code elimination
- Strict typing
- Native support for fixedpoint numbers (including support for degree-to-radian and float-to-fixedpoint conversion)
<!-- - Native support for PewPew Marketplace -->
<!-- - Integrated language server -->

However, Hybroid does come with certain limitations:
- Not beginner-friendly
- No support for Lua interoperability
